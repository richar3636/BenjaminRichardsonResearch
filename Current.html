<p><strong>1.) Hololens Long Wear Comfort Research</strong><br />
Designed a series of studies where participants wore a variety of
Hololens prototypes and performed various activities that resemble
front-line worker job duties. Participants were interrupted in regular
intervals over the course of the three hour study sessions and asked to
respond to a series of questions regarding their comfort, fatigue and
perceptions regarding wearing the devices for a whole day shift. We also
recorded a series of head scans using a 3DMD high resolution scanning
camera array to document how the headsets sit on the head before and
after work. This research provided important data that informed design
changes in future Hololens devices that will be more balanced and
comfortable for folks who may be able to utilize Hololens augmented
reality during their workday.<br />

<p><strong>Military Hololens Research</strong><br />
An important application of Hololens Augmented Reality is utilization in
helmets of military personnel which may aid in identifying normally
difficult to see stimuli and providing recommendation systems that
improve efficiency and accuracy. To inform improvements of design we
conducted a series of studies recruiting active military personel to don
a variety of headset designs and perform a series of navigation tasks in
a lab space. We recorded motion capture and EMG data to evaluate
efficiency of performing tasks and muscle strain over time. After
performing tasks, participants provided qualitative feedback regarding
their experience and willingness to adopt the technology in the
field.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>2.) Microsoft Surface Haptic Feedback Research</strong> I
work closely with the Microsoft Surface team to design studies that
inform re-design and improvement of touchpad haptics. Most recently I
designed a series of studies that recorded EMG while interacting with
various haptic touchpad models using different waveform conditions to
determine a distribution of how individuals respond to various haptic
settings. I coupled this with individual differences in sound
perception, user interviews and likert scale ratings to determine user
thresholds for perceiving touchpad sounds, and preferences for haptic
feedback of different haptic prototype devices.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>3.) Mixed Reality Desktops</strong> Other work at Microsoft
involved designing user studies that examined computer desktop working
behavior and utilization of larger more spacious environments via mixed
reality. This involves examining how fast participants could complete
simple navigation, search and selection tasks using different virtual
desktop options. Qualitative data was also collected in the form of user
interviews probing preferences for desktop arrangements.</p>

<h2><strong>Academic research outside work at Microsoft</strong></h2>
<p>I am currently working on designing a series of experiments that will
further examines action and perception feature repetition and hosting
these studies on this page using <a
href="https://pavlovia.org/">Pavlovia</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>The following are a couple of the studies which I am currently
working on which will provide further information regarding how and what
mechanisms are involved in resolving confusion that occurs when multiple
actions are simultaneously activated.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1.) <strong>Working Memory Manipulation</strong> - This is an
expansion on the topics of my doctoral dissertation. Embedding a
Sternberg letter recall task within our partial repetition task. The
goal of this is to experimentally manipulate working memory load while
also manipulating whether action features repeat or not between planned
and intervening actions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2.) <strong>EEG recording during partial repetition task</strong> - I
originally collected EEG data during our partial repetition task in
2018, however there were some issues with the data and this required
recollection which did not end up happening due to the COVID-19
pandemic. If working memory processes are involved in the
disentanglement of simultaneously activated action plan then we should
easily be able to identify event related components and temporal
frequency power changes related to working memory processes during
execution of the intervening action in our partial repetition task.
Additionally coupling EEG data with pupilometry data may provide
important new information regarding how the brain and body recruit
resources that allow for the fast adaptation to sudden unexpected
environment changes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Cooperative behavior and partial repetition
costs</strong> - Research in cooperative action and embodied cognition
show that observing others behaviors causes automatic mapping of others
behavior onto our own action representation system. This embodiment has
also beens shown to vary in intensity depending on how much on
identifies with the person being observed (i.e., belonging to the same
group, sharing attributes…). If observed actions are automatically
mapped to our own action system, it is possible that partial repetition
costs may be found for an individual completing an intervening action
when a co-actor is planning a task that shares action features.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4.) <strong>Sleep deprivation and partial repetition costs</strong> -
Sleep deprivation has been show to dramatically impact the ability to
make well informed decisions, maintain information in working memory,
and respond quickly and appropriately in response to sudden changes.
Therefore it is likely that individuals who are sleep deprived will show
amplified partial repetition costs but this has yet to be explored.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4.) <strong>Individual differences in partial repetition
costs</strong> - our research examining hazard rates of intervening
response times when action features are repeated showed some individuals
tended to respond very fast and other tended to respond very slow to the
intervening response. Interestingly, the fast participants showed
complete elimination of partial repetition costs after repeated action
training while the slow responders showed only reductions in partial
repetition costs after training.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="new-publication-examining-hazard-rates-of-response-times"
class="section level2">
<h2><strong>New publication examining hazard rates of response
times</strong></h2>
<p>As noted in the “In Works” section of the “Publications” tab, I have
been working on finalizing a paper demonstrating examination of hazard
rates for response times can show how response activation changes over
time and how this differs across conditions where action features
overlap or do not. Application of hazard rates to examine response
activation to day has not happened in the literature yet. Therefore,
this paper will argue that examination of hazard rates can show
important information that examination of traditional measures of
response times (mean, median) cannot show.<br />
<br />
I will be posting some of the figures and captions soon to provide a
sneak preview of what the paper will show.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="eye-tracking-and-pupilometry" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Eye tracking and pupilometry</strong></h2>
<p>I have been conducting a series of studies at Microsoft using eye
tracking and pupilometry to examine what people focus on when
interacting with laptops and other digital devices. I am currently
working on applying some of these methods to perceptual research related
to attentional blindness when action features related to visual stimuli
are repeated vs not repeated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-new-packages-in-python-and-r" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Creating new packages in Python and R</strong></h2>
<p>My recent research has revealed that examining hazard rates of
response times provides important information regarding how response
activation changes over time. This is a relatively novel way of
examining response times compared to the traditional methods of
measuring central tendency such as mean or median. Its also possible to
apply this method of analysis to other aspects of behavior such as EEG
and EMG.</p>
